# Trillio

It's a dashboard wherein a user can login and look for reviews and feedback along with the booking of hotel, flight, rental car or a tour. Have a look at the UI (No component is gonna work, it's just the frontend). Extensive use of flexbox along with utilizing the power of Sass. Below is an image of how it looks. It's deployed on Github!
